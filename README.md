# SudokuSolver
A simple Sudoku solver that uses backtracking to solve any puzzle regardless of difficulty.

## Introduction
This is just a quick and dirty implementation of the [backtracking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku_solving_algorithms#Backtracking) algorithm for Sudoku solving. This uses [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/) for nicer array manipulation, but that's not necessary, it just made development quicker.

## Features
Type in a puzzle, using 0's as blank spaces. See the example at the top of the script. It'll solve it, either while describing each step in the process (if you use the first script) or silently (if you use the second script). It's barebones, designed to be a simple understandable implementation, rather than anything too fancy.

## Installation & Usage
Clone the repo, install Python (and Numpy), and run the script.

## Contributing
Feel free to contribute as you wish, I'll accept all pull and merge requests if they're decent.
